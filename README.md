1.	UML Diagram

•	The UML Diagram of the program is divided into two smaller diagrams to enhance readability. 
•	The only difference in the two diagrams is the set of Concrete Factories. 
•	The Abstract factory, Abstract Products and Concrete products are the same in both the diagrams.

2.	Source Code

•	Extract the zip file.
•	Open the folder named “SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator” and double click the solution file.
•	If this does not work, the source code files are in the folder “SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\ Project1 - Menu Generator”.

3.	Directory

a.	The input file paths are hardcoded into the program. The paths are virtual (relative to the executable file) and are adaptable to other file systems. The paths for the input files are as follows.
•	SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\Project1 - Menu Generator\bin\Debug\FoodItemData.xml
•	SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\Project1 - Menu Generator\bin\Debug\FoodItemData.json

b.	Three output files will be generated for HTML, XML and Text formats respectively. Previous versions of these files will be overwritten after subsequent executions of the program.

c.	The output files can be found at
•	SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\Project1 - Menu Generator\bin\Debug\menu.html
•	SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\Project1 - Menu Generator\bin\Debug\menu.xml
•	SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\Project1 - Menu Generator\bin\Debug\menu.txt
4.	Running the application
a.	The executable to run this application can be found at 

•	SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator\Project1 – Menu Generator\bin\Debug\Project1 - Menu Generator.exe

b.	If the above step does not work

•	Double click the solution file in the folder “SD-Assn1.zip\SD-Assn1\Project1 - Menu Generator”
•	Choose Build on the menu bar, and then choose Build Solution.
•	Choose Debug on the menu bar and then choose Start without Debugging.
